(*
Write a PolishCalculator module that implements a stack-based calculator that adopts polish notation for the expressions to be evaluated.

Polish Notation is a prefix notation wherein every operator follows all of its operands; 
this notation has the big advantage of being unambiguous and permits to avoid the use of parenthesis. 
E.g., (3+4)*5 is equal to 3 4 + 5 *.

The module should include an:
- Expr datatype representing an expression
- a function expr_of+string: string â†’ Expr which build the expression in the corresponding infix notation out of the string in polish notation;
- a function eval: Expr â†’ int which will evaluate the expression and returns such evaluation
The recognized operators should be +, - (both unary and binary), *, /, ** over integers. At least a space ends each operands and operators.

The evaluation/translation can be realized by pushing the recognized elements on a stack. 
Define the module independently of the Stack implementation and try to use functors to adapt it.
